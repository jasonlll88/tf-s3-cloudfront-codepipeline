## Requirements

- The infrastructure should be codified using Terraform and provisioned in such a way that it can be redeployed to a different account with minor variable changes.
- S3 should be configured as a static site and used to host the content.
- Amazon CloudFront should be configured to distribute the content from the S3 static site.
- Amazon CloudFront’s default behavior should be configured to not cache.
- Amazon CloudFront should have an additional behavior configured to cache an image for a default / minimum / maximum TTL = 30 minutes.
- Amazon CloudFront should have SSL enabled using the Default CloudFront Certificate
- CodePipeline should be configured in such a way to deploy / update the files for the site.
- CodePipeline should trigger off any commits or pull requests merged to a specific branch of the site’s source code git repository.
- CodePipeline should invalidate the CloudFront Distribution after adding files to the site.


# Terraform setup for S3 Static site, Cloudfront, and Codepipeline

This repository contains a complete deployment for an S3 Static Site setup as the origin for a CloudFront distribution and with the CICD pipelines with Codepipeline to update the S3 bucket files each commit to the main branch and invalidate the cache of the CloudFront distribution.

![Diagram](tf-s3-website-cfront-cpipeline.png "Diagram")

there are some values that you can customize for this deployment and you can find them in the  `deploy/apply-tfvars/dev.tfvars` file.

## To deploy go to the folder `deploy`

The deployment is made with Terraform, and it was divided into three modules as follows

### 1. S3

S3 module is in charge of the creation and configuration for the S3 bucket as a static website

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
|bucket_name|part of the name that compuond the S3 bucket name|`string`| |yes|
|index_document|path to the index document for the webhost site|`string`| |yes|
|error_document|path to the error document for the webhost site|`string`| |yes|


Outputs:  
bucket_arn  
bucket_website_endpoint  
bucket_id  



### 2. Cloudfront
Cloudfront module in is charge of the creation of the cloudfront distribution and the two behavior for cache
| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
|price_class|option to select the edge location for the cloudfront distribution, valid values PriceClass_All, PriceClass_200, PriceClass_100|`string`| |yes|

Outputs:  
distribution_id  





### 3. Codepipeline
| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
|code_pipeline_name|Name for the codepipeline|`string`| |yes|
|lambda_name|Name for the lambda function used to invalidate the cache|`string`| |yes|


## How setup to deploy to specific acocunt


- Make sure to have your credentials in the ~/.aws/credentials folder or in the envvars
- go to the folder deploy
- if you have setup DynamoDB table and S3 bucket where to upload and lock the state file, please modify the values in the file `deploy/init-tfvars/dev.tfvars`, otherwise you can comment the content of the file `deploy/-state.tf`
- for each case execute the corresponding `terraform init` or `terraform init -backend-config=./init-tfvars/dev.tfvars`
- then execute terraform apply `terraform destroy -var-file ./apply-tfvars/dev.tfvars `
- with the first deployment you need to complete a manual step in AWS CodePipeline to stablish the connection to the github repository.
